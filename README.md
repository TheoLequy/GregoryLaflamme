# GregoryLaflamme
This paper is the result of my Semester Thesis with Prof. Peter Hinty in higher dimensional General Relativity. 
Based on the proof of Collinbourne [1] an approoach with gauge-invariants is used to show that Black Strings and Rings in 5 dimensions have a mode instability, the so called Gregory-Laflamme Instability. All derivations can be found in the Mathematica notebook.

Abstract:
On higher-dimensional spacetimes, there exist a large variety of different black-hole type solutions to the vacuum Einstein Field Equations. 
By taking the product manifold of the Schwarzschild solution with the flat manifolds $\mathbb{R}$ or $\mathbb{S}^1$ we can create the black string and black ring solutions. 
However, in contrast to the Schwarzschild solution in four spacetime dimensions, those five-dimensional solutions are generally dynamically unstable under perturbations as seen through the Gregory-Laflamme instability.
In this article, we present a slight modification to the rigorous mathematical proof by Collingbourne [1] by remaining in the harmonic/transverse-traceless gauge throughout the derivation.
We show that the linearized Einstein field equations admit a spherically symmetric, exponentially growing mode solution with admissible behavior at the horizon and spacelike infinity.
