# GregoryLaflamme
This paper is the result of my Semester Thesis with Prof. Peter Hinty in higher dimensional General Relativity. 
Based on the proof of Collinbourne [1] a gauge-free approach is used to show that Black Strings and Rings in 5 dimensions have a mode instability, the so called Gregory-Laflamme Instability.
